<h1>FEATURESâœ¨</h1
               
**Make it fast to add and organize tasks**. Ideally, a task is added and categorized in a couple taps or keystrokes. If adding your to-dos is a hassle, you just won't do it.

**Offer multiple ways to organize your tasks**. Tags, lists, projects, and due dates are all helpful, and the best to-do apps offer at least a few categories like this.

**Remind you about self-imposed deadlines**. Notifications, widgets, emailsâ€”if you're using an online to-do list, it should help you track what needs to happen when. This is one of the big reasons to use an app over a notebook.
